This technological revolution opens unprecedented opportunities for advancements across every domain of human endeavor, while profoundly challenging the very foundations of society in an increasingly complex and evolving geopolitical order. For developing countries, AI offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog traditional developmental pathways. The multi-modal and multi-lingual capabilities of AI create new possibilities through which access to benefits can be made available at scale. As a result, AI is seen not merely as a technological advancement but as a strategic tool to enable inclusive growth and expand access to opportunities that have historically been out of reach for large segments of the population.\n\nRecognizing this transformative potential, the past four years have witnessed a remarkable surge in multilateral initiatives dedicated to harnessing AI's potential responsibly and equitably. From the G20 AI Principles to the UN and Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) Resolutions on AI, the African Declaration on AI, and most recently, the Hamburg Declaration on Responsible AI, these efforts reflect unprecedented international recognition that AI's transformative impact transcends borders and requires coordinated global action.\n\nDespite these high-level commitments, a fundamental gap persists between global aspirations and the reality on the ground. The Global AI Divide continues to widen, with AI resources and capabilities concentrated among select nations and corporations. This concentration fundamentally limits the development of social, cultural, and linguistically contextual AI solutions, constraining AI's potential to accelerate progress toward our collective development goals, especially for the Global South.\n\nSimultaneously, AI's rapid proliferation across society is creating new challenges that demand urgent attention: disrupting traditional employment patterns, exacerbating existing biases, and driving exponential increases in energy consumption. These developments underscore the urgent need to move beyond aspirational frameworks toward concrete, measurable impact that addresses both AI's promise and its perils.\n\nThe Mantra: A Time for Impact\n\nThe India–AI Impact Summit 2026, announced by Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the France AI Action Summit and scheduled for February 19–20 in New Delhi, will be the first-ever global AI summit hosted in the Global South.\n\nBuilding on the momentum of leading international forums such as the UK AI Safety Summit, the AI Seoul Summit, the France AI Action Summit, and the Global AI Summit on Africa, this high-level convening marks a critical inflection point. It will strengthen existing multilateral initiatives while advancing new priorities, deliverables, and cooperative frameworks—moving from high-level political statements to demonstrable impact and tangible progress in global AI cooperation.\n\nThe Summit charts a path towards a future where the transformative power of AI serves humanity, drives inclusive growth, fosters social development, and promotes people-centric innovations that protect our planet. It also seeks to amplify the voice of the Global South, ensuring that technological advancements and opportunities are shared broadly, not concentrated in a few regions.\n\nAt the same time, AI’s rapid proliferation across society poses urgent challenges—disrupting traditional employment patterns, exacerbating biases, and accelerating energy consumption. These developments highlight the pressing need to go beyond aspirational frameworks and deliver measurable, concrete impact that addresses both the promise and the perils of AI.\n\nThe Three Sutras\n\nThe India - AI Impact Summit will be anchored on three foundational pillars, known as 'Sutras'—a Sanskrit term meaning guiding principles or essential threads that weave together wisdom and action. These three Sutras define how AI can be harnessed through multilateral cooperation for collective benefit\n\nPeople\n\nThe People Sutra envisions AI as a force for human progress—respecting cultural diversity, preserving dignity, and ensuring inclusion in its design and deployment. It affirms that technology must remain human-centred, advance people-first development while upholding safety, trust, and shared benefit.\n\nPlanet\n\nThe Planet Sutra calls for AI that advances innovation responsibly—reducing its resource footprint while accelerating climate resilience and environmental protection. It upholds that technological progress must align with planetary stewardship, ensuring AI strengthens rather than undermines global sustainability.\n\nProgress\n\nThe Progress Sutra envisages AI as an engine for inclusive growth—aligning its benefits with global development priorities and equitable access to opportunity. It emphasizes democratizing key AI resources and applying AI to accelerate socio-economic progress across sectors such as health, education, governance, and agriculture.\n\nThe Seven Chakras\n\nBuilding upon the three foundational Sutras, the deliberations at the AI Impact Summit will be organized around seven interconnected Chakras, areas of multilateral cooperation designed to channel collective energy toward holistic societal transformation. These Seven Chakras represent focused domains of international collaboration that translate the broader principles of People, Planet, and Progress into concrete areas of action:\n\nHuman Capital\n\nInclusion for Social Empowerment\n\nSafe and Trusted AI\n\nResilience, Innovation, and Efficiency\n\nScience\n\nDemocratizing AI Resources\n\nAI for Economic Growth and Social Good\n\nEach Chakra represents a distinct yet interconnected sphere of multilateral engagement through which the transformative potential of AI can be harnessed to deliver tangible benefits aligned with the three Sutras. Together, they offer a comprehensive framework that enables countries, international organizations, and stakeholders to coordinate AI deployment strategies that enable the maximization of collective benefits while still addressing shared challenges.\n\nSafe & Trusted AI\n\nAs AI reshapes economies and societies, concerns around safety, transparency, and trust call for robust, technology-enabled safeguards that can match the sophistication and scale of modern AI systems. The Safe & Trusted AI Chakra seeks to close this governance gap by empowering all nations to participate meaningfully in AI oversight while supporting continued innovation and technological advancement.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAI is transforming the global employment landscape, creating new opportunities while disrupting traditional jobs and skills. Fragmented responses, absence of global AI literacy standards, and insufficient investment in workforce transition threaten to deepen the \"AI divide.\" The Human Capital Chakra addresses these challenges by advancing equitable skilling, inclusive workforce transition, and broad sharing of AI-driven productivity gains.\n\nScience\n\nAI is reshaping how science is done, from genomics and drug discovery to climate and materials research. The Science Chakra aims to promote AI in frontier science research and translate breakthroughs into inclusive, real-world impact through strengthening global scientific collaboration, establishing clear scientific norms and transparency standards for AI in research.\n\nResilience, Innovation & Efficiency\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, its heavy environmental and energy footprint threatens climate resilience and inclusive growth across the world. The Resilience, Innovation & Efficiency Chakra promotes frugal, adaptable and sustainable AI, lightweight modular systems that work in low-resource contexts without compromising impact and performance.\n\nInclusion for Social Empowerment\n\nAI technologies hold immense potential for advancing socio-economic outcomes – provided appropriate measures are taken to ensure their design, development, and deployment are inclusive. The Inclusion for Social Empowerment Chakra at the AI Impact Summit 2026 is to encourage design, development, and deployment of AI systems that actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users.\n\nDemocratizing AI Resources\n\nThe growing demands of AI development require vast infrastructure—compute and hardware, data infrastructure—that are concentrated in a few regions today, reinforcing global inequalities in innovation capacity. The Democratizing AI Resources Chakra seeks to democratize these foundational infrastructure resources through improving affordability, access and demand for all nations to foster inclusive technological progress.\n\nEconomic Growth & Social Good\n\nAI holds significant potential to catalyse economic growth and advance inclusive societal progress. The Economic Growth and Social Good Chakra at the AI Impact Summit 2026 seeks to promote AI-driven pathways that not only strengthen service delivery and access in critical sectors but also generate measurable contributions to productivity, innovation, and growth, thereby advancing inclusive and equitable development.\n\nThe Impact of AI\n\nAchieving this vision requires global consensus on how AI is developed and applied in ways that serve the Planet, its People, and the Progress of all. This includes rethinking how data is managed, how AI models are designed and deployed, and how these technologies are integrated into our social and economic fabric. The India AI Summit aims to build consensus on all these issues so that AI’s Impact is realized equitably by all.\n\nThe AI Impact Summit represents more than a gathering of leaders; it embodies a commitment to amplify the positive impact of AI. Through the three foundational Sutras and seven focused Chakras, the global community will forge concrete pathways that ensure AI serves the Planet, empowers all People, and accelerates Progress for every nation.\n\nPowered By\n\nSite Navigation\n\nHome\n\nAbout Summit\n\nPre-Summit Event\n\nWorking Groups\n\nMedia\n\nIndia AI Mission\n\nFlagship Events\n\nAI for ALL: Global Impact Challenge\n\nAI by HER: Global Impact Challenge\n\nYUVAI: Global Youth Challenge\n\nResearch Symposium\n\nIndia AI Impact Expo 2026\n\nIndia AI Tinkerpreneur\n\nCasebook on AI Health\n\nCasebook on AI in Energy\n\nCasebook on AI and Gender Empowerment\n\nCasebook on AI in Education\n\nCasebook on AI and Agriculture\n\nCasebook on AI in Accessibility\n\nContact Us\n\nEmail Us\n\n-\n\nimpact-summit[at]indiaai[dot]gov[dot]in\n\nIndiaAI Mission\n4th Floor, Electronics Niketan,\n6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road,\nNew Delhi-110003 (India)\n\n© 2026 - Copyright India AI Impact Summit\n\nUX4G Accessibility Tool\n\nAccessibility options\n\nCtrl+F2\n\nBigger Text\n\nSmaller Text\n\nText Spacing\n\nLine Height\n\nDyslexia Friendly\n\nADHD Mode\n\nSaturation\n\nLow Saturation\n\nHigh Saturation\n\nDesaturate\n\nLight-Dark\n\nInvert Colors\n\nHighlight Links\n\nText To Speech\n\nCursor\n\nPause Animation\n\nHide Images\n\nReset All Settings\n\nCreated by\n\nCtrl+F2\n\nAccessibility Options\n\nOpen the accessibility option",

This technological revolution opens unprecedented opportunities for advancements across every domain of human endeavor, while profoundly challenging the very foundations of society in an increasingly complex and evolving geopolitical order. For developing countries, AI offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog traditional developmental pathways. The multi-modal and multi-lingual capabilities of AI create new possibilities through which access to benefits can be made available at scale. As a result, AI is seen not merely as a technological advancement but as a strategic tool to enable inclusive growth and expand access to opportunities that have historically been out of reach for large segments of the population.\n\nRecognizing this transformative potential, the past four years have witnessed a remarkable surge in multilateral initiatives dedicated to harnessing AI's potential responsibly and equitably. From the G20 AI Principles to the UN and Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) Resolutions on AI, the African Declaration on AI, and most recently, the Hamburg Declaration on Responsible AI, these efforts reflect unprecedented international recognition that AI's transformative impact transcends borders and requires coordinated global action.\n\nDespite these high-level commitments, a fundamental gap persists between global aspirations and the reality on the ground. The Global AI Divide continues to widen, with AI resources and capabilities concentrated among select nations and corporations. This concentration fundamentally limits the development of social, cultural, and linguistically contextual AI solutions, constraining AI's potential to accelerate progress toward our collective development goals, especially for the Global South.\n\nSimultaneously, AI's rapid proliferation across society is creating new challenges that demand urgent attention: disrupting traditional employment patterns, exacerbating existing biases, and driving exponential increases in energy consumption. These developments underscore the urgent need to move beyond aspirational frameworks toward concrete, measurable impact that addresses both AI's promise and its perils.\n\nThe Mantra: A Time for Impact\n\nThe India–AI Impact Summit 2026, announced by Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the France AI Action Summit and scheduled for February 19–20 in New Delhi, will be the first-ever global AI summit hosted in the Global South.\n\nBuilding on the momentum of leading international forums such as the UK AI Safety Summit, the AI Seoul Summit, the France AI Action Summit, and the Global AI Summit on Africa, this high-level convening marks a critical inflection point. It will strengthen existing multilateral initiatives while advancing new priorities, deliverables, and cooperative frameworks—moving from high-level political statements to demonstrable impact and tangible progress in global AI cooperation.\n\nThe Summit charts a path towards a future where the transformative power of AI serves humanity, drives inclusive growth, fosters social development, and promotes people-centric innovations that protect our planet. It also seeks to amplify the voice of the Global South, ensuring that technological advancements and opportunities are shared broadly, not concentrated in a few regions.\n\nAt the same time, AI’s rapid proliferation across society poses urgent challenges—disrupting traditional employment patterns, exacerbating biases, and accelerating energy consumption. These developments highlight the pressing need to go beyond aspirational frameworks and deliver measurable, concrete impact that addresses both the promise and the perils of AI.\n\nThe Three Sutras\n\nThe India - AI Impact Summit will be anchored on three foundational pillars, known as 'Sutras'—a Sanskrit term meaning guiding principles or essential threads that weave together wisdom and action. These three Sutras define how AI can be harnessed through multilateral cooperation for collective benefit\n\nPeople\n\nThe People Sutra envisions AI as a force for human progress—respecting cultural diversity, preserving dignity, and ensuring inclusion in its design and deployment. It affirms that technology must remain human-centred, advance people-first development while upholding safety, trust, and shared benefit.\n\nPlanet\n\nThe Planet Sutra calls for AI that advances innovation responsibly—reducing its resource footprint while accelerating climate resilience and environmental protection. It upholds that technological progress must align with planetary stewardship, ensuring AI strengthens rather than undermines global sustainability.\n\nProgress\n\nThe Progress Sutra envisages AI as an engine for inclusive growth—aligning its benefits with global development priorities and equitable access to opportunity. It emphasizes democratizing key AI resources and applying AI to accelerate socio-economic progress across sectors such as health, education, governance, and agriculture.\n\nThe Seven Chakras\n\nBuilding upon the three foundational Sutras, the deliberations at the AI Impact Summit will be organized around seven interconnected Chakras, areas of multilateral cooperation designed to channel collective energy toward holistic societal transformation. These Seven Chakras represent focused domains of international collaboration that translate the broader principles of People, Planet, and Progress into concrete areas of action:\n\nHuman Capital\n\nInclusion for Social Empowerment\n\nSafe and Trusted AI\n\nResilience, Innovation, and Efficiency\n\nScience\n\nDemocratizing AI Resources\n\nAI for Economic Growth and Social Good\n\nEach Chakra represents a distinct yet interconnected sphere of multilateral engagement through which the transformative potential of AI can be harnessed to deliver tangible benefits aligned with the three Sutras. Together, they offer a comprehensive framework that enables countries, international organizations, and stakeholders to coordinate AI deployment strategies that enable the maximization of collective benefits while still addressing shared challenges.\n\nSafe & Trusted AI\n\nAs AI reshapes economies and societies, concerns around safety, transparency, and trust call for robust, technology-enabled safeguards that can match the sophistication and scale of modern AI systems. The Safe & Trusted AI Chakra seeks to close this governance gap by empowering all nations to participate meaningfully in AI oversight while supporting continued innovation and technological advancement.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAI is transforming the global employment landscape, creating new opportunities while disrupting traditional jobs and skills. Fragmented responses, absence of global AI literacy standards, and insufficient investment in workforce transition threaten to deepen the \"AI divide.\" The Human Capital Chakra addresses these challenges by advancing equitable skilling, inclusive workforce transition, and broad sharing of AI-driven productivity gains.\n\nScience\n\nAI is reshaping how science is done, from genomics and drug discovery to climate and materials research. The Science Chakra aims to promote AI in frontier science research and translate breakthroughs into inclusive, real-world impact through strengthening global scientific collaboration, establishing clear scientific norms and transparency standards for AI in research.\n\nResilience, Innovation & Efficiency\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, its heavy environmental and energy footprint threatens climate resilience and inclusive growth across the world. The Resilience, Innovation & Efficiency Chakra promotes frugal, adaptable and sustainable AI, lightweight modular systems that work in low-resource contexts without compromising impact and performance.\n\nInclusion for Social Empowerment\n\nAI technologies hold immense potential for advancing socio-economic outcomes – provided appropriate measures are taken to ensure their design, development, and deployment are inclusive. The Inclusion for Social Empowerment Chakra at the AI Impact Summit 2026 is to encourage design, development, and deployment of AI systems that actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users.\n\nDemocratizing AI Resources\n\nThe growing demands of AI development require vast infrastructure—compute and hardware, data infrastructure—that are concentrated in a few regions today, reinforcing global inequalities in innovation capacity. The Democratizing AI Resources Chakra seeks to democratize these foundational infrastructure resources through improving affordability, access and demand for all nations to foster inclusive technological progress.\n\nEconomic Growth & Social Good\n\nAI holds significant potential to catalyse economic growth and advance inclusive societal progress. The Economic Growth and Social Good Chakra at the AI Impact Summit 2026 seeks to promote AI-driven pathways that not only strengthen service delivery and access in critical sectors but also generate measurable contributions to productivity, innovation, and growth, thereby advancing inclusive and equitable development.\n\nThe Impact of AI\n\nAchieving this vision requires global consensus on how AI is developed and applied in ways that serve the Planet, its People, and the Progress of all. This includes rethinking how data is managed, how AI models are designed and deployed, and how these technologies are integrated into our social and economic fabric. The India AI Summit aims to build consensus on all these issues so that AI’s Impact is realized equitably by all.\n\nThe AI Impact Summit represents more than a gathering of leaders; it embodies a commitment to amplify the positive impact of AI. Through the three foundational Sutras and seven focused Chakras, the global community will forge concrete pathways that ensure AI serves the Planet, empowers all People, and accelerates Progress for every nation.\n\nPowered By\n\nSite Navigation\n\nHome\n\nAbout Summit\n\nPre-Summit Event\n\nWorking Groups\n\nMedia\n\nIndia AI Mission\n\nFlagship Events\n\nAI for ALL: Global Impact Challenge\n\nAI by HER: Global Impact Challenge\n\nYUVAI: Global Youth Challenge\n\nResearch Symposium\n\nIndia AI Impact Expo 2026\n\nIndia AI Tinkerpreneur\n\nCasebook on AI Health\n\nCasebook on AI in Energy\n\nCasebook on AI and Gender Empowerment\n\nCasebook on AI in Education\n\nCasebook on AI and Agriculture\n\nCasebook on AI in Accessibility\n\nContact Us\n\nEmail Us\n\n-\n\nimpact-summit[at]indiaai[dot]gov[dot]in\n\nIndiaAI Mission\n4th Floor, Electronics Niketan,\n6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road,\nNew Delhi-110003 (India)\n\n© 2026 - Copyright India AI Impact Summit\n\nUX4G Accessibility Tool\n\nAccessibility options\n\nCtrl+F2\n\nBigger Text\n\nSmaller Text\n\nText Spacing\n\nLine Height\n\nDyslexia Friendly\n\nADHD Mode\n\nSaturation\n\nLow Saturation\n\nHigh Saturation\n\nDesaturate\n\nLight-Dark\n\nInvert Colors\n\nHighlight Links\n\nText To Speech\n\nCursor\n\nPause Animation\n\nHide Images\n\nReset All Settings\n\nCreated by\n\nCtrl+F2\n\nAccessibility Options\n\nOpen the accessibility option",

The Inclusion for Social Empowerment thematic working group aims to enable the development and adoption of inclusive AI for social empowerment of all, ensuring no one is left behind.\n\nVision & Objectives\n\nBuilding an equitable global AI ecosystem\n\nVision\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Inclusion for Social Empowerment Working Group will explore pathways that can be used to ensure AI can act as a catalyst for social empowerment. Its focus is to enable participation, expand opportunity, and unlock human potential across languages, abilities, geographies, and cultures. It will centre solutions, capacity building, and scalable models that deliver tangible benefits for all, especially  underserved communities.\n\nLeadership\n\nMr Rajesh Aggarwal\n\nIndia Co-Chair\n\nSecretary, Department for Empowerment of Persons with   Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of   India\n\nMr. Rajesh Aggarwal is currently serving as Secretary for the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). Across multiple roles at a federal and state level, he has championed the use of technology to improve governance, playing a foundational role in the creation and improvement of the Digilocker, Jeevan Praman and other significant e-governance programmes. Mr. Aggarwal also has a distinguished track record in making public services and infrastructure accessible for persons with disabilities, including ensuring government websites and public spaces are inclusive for all.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nNigeria\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nKey Issues\n\nUnderstanding the global AI divide and our approach to bridging it\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTranslating potential AI-driven benefits into tangible outcomes depends on the readiness of deployers and users to effectively manage and use the technology. This means providing relevant AI literacy, awareness and training to not just beneficiaries, but those who ensure they are available to the beneficiaries – such as last-mile field   workers, educators, administrators and even managers of developers.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe fragmented nature of the development of AI tools and initiatives for social empowerment means that at present, effective solutions cannot be replicated or scaled up easily. This emphasises the need for mechanisms to actively share technical   learnings and guidance that can ensure that successful programmes in one region can be translated to others.\n\nThe Impact\n\nTo ensure that these AI technologies are able to truly deliver their transformative potential, it is important for them to actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users, including those from the Global South and from traditionally underserved communities. Efforts to improve inclusivity-by design need to be continued to ensure the improvement of AI systems’ safety, relevance and usability\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n16th December 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Hyderabad)\n\nUpcoming\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.

The Inclusion for Social Empowerment thematic working group aims to enable the development and adoption of inclusive AI for social empowerment of all, ensuring no one is left behind.\n\nVision & Objectives\n\nBuilding an equitable global AI ecosystem\n\nVision\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Inclusion for Social Empowerment Working Group will explore pathways that can be used to ensure AI can act as a catalyst for social empowerment. Its focus is to enable participation, expand opportunity, and unlock human potential across languages, abilities, geographies, and cultures. It will centre solutions, capacity building, and scalable models that deliver tangible benefits for all, especially  underserved communities.\n\nLeadership\n\nMr Rajesh Aggarwal\n\nIndia Co-Chair\n\nSecretary, Department for Empowerment of Persons with   Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of   India\n\nMr. Rajesh Aggarwal is currently serving as Secretary for the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). Across multiple roles at a federal and state level, he has championed the use of technology to improve governance, playing a foundational role in the creation and improvement of the Digilocker, Jeevan Praman and other significant e-governance programmes. Mr. Aggarwal also has a distinguished track record in making public services and infrastructure accessible for persons with disabilities, including ensuring government websites and public spaces are inclusive for all.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nNigeria\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nKey Issues\n\nUnderstanding the global AI divide and our approach to bridging it\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTranslating potential AI-driven benefits into tangible outcomes depends on the readiness of deployers and users to effectively manage and use the technology. This means providing relevant AI literacy, awareness and training to not just beneficiaries, but those who ensure they are available to the beneficiaries – such as last-mile field   workers, educators, administrators and even managers of developers.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe fragmented nature of the development of AI tools and initiatives for social empowerment means that at present, effective solutions cannot be replicated or scaled up easily. This emphasises the need for mechanisms to actively share technical   learnings and guidance that can ensure that successful programmes in one region can be translated to others.\n\nThe Impact\n\nTo ensure that these AI technologies are able to truly deliver their transformative potential, it is important for them to actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users, including those from the Global South and from traditionally underserved communities. Efforts to improve inclusivity-by design need to be continued to ensure the improvement of AI systems’ safety, relevance and usability\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n16th December 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Hyderabad)\n\nUpcoming\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.

The Inclusion for Social Empowerment thematic working group aims to enable the development and adoption of inclusive AI for social empowerment of all, ensuring no one is left behind.\n\nVision & Objectives\n\nBuilding an equitable global AI ecosystem\n\nVision\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Inclusion for Social Empowerment Working Group will explore pathways that can be used to ensure AI can act as a catalyst for social empowerment. Its focus is to enable participation, expand opportunity, and unlock human potential across languages, abilities, geographies, and cultures. It will centre solutions, capacity building, and scalable models that deliver tangible benefits for all, especially  underserved communities.\n\nLeadership\n\nMr Rajesh Aggarwal\n\nIndia Co-Chair\n\nSecretary, Department for Empowerment of Persons with   Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of   India\n\nMr. Rajesh Aggarwal is currently serving as Secretary for the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). Across multiple roles at a federal and state level, he has championed the use of technology to improve governance, playing a foundational role in the creation and improvement of the Digilocker, Jeevan Praman and other significant e-governance programmes. Mr. Aggarwal also has a distinguished track record in making public services and infrastructure accessible for persons with disabilities, including ensuring government websites and public spaces are inclusive for all.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nNigeria\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nKey Issues\n\nUnderstanding the global AI divide and our approach to bridging it\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTranslating potential AI-driven benefits into tangible outcomes depends on the readiness of deployers and users to effectively manage and use the technology. This means providing relevant AI literacy, awareness and training to not just beneficiaries, but those who ensure they are available to the beneficiaries – such as last-mile field   workers, educators, administrators and even managers of developers.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe fragmented nature of the development of AI tools and initiatives for social empowerment means that at present, effective solutions cannot be replicated or scaled up easily. This emphasises the need for mechanisms to actively share technical   learnings and guidance that can ensure that successful programmes in one region can be translated to others.\n\nThe Impact\n\nTo ensure that these AI technologies are able to truly deliver their transformative potential, it is important for them to actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users, including those from the Global South and from traditionally underserved communities. Efforts to improve inclusivity-by design need to be continued to ensure the improvement of AI systems’ safety, relevance and usability\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n16th December 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Hyderabad)\n\nUpcoming\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.

While these developments can drive efficiency and innovation, they also risk displacing   segments of the workforce, particularly in labour-intensive and intermediary roles,   potentially widening existing socio-economic divides if not managed carefully.\n\nThe Solution\n\nAt the same time, many countries, especially in the Global South, face capacity and   resource gaps that constrain their ability to prepare workers for the AI-enabled   economy. This presents an opportunity for the international community to collaborate   on meaningful reskilling initiatives that build workforce readiness for the digital and AI driven future.\n\nThe Impact\n\nEnsuring a just and inclusive transition requires prioritising reskilling and upskilling   initiatives that equip individuals affected by automation with the capabilities needed to   adapt to new and emerging roles.\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n5th-6th January 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Guwahati)\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.

The Inclusion for Social Empowerment thematic working group aims to enable the development and adoption of inclusive AI for social empowerment of all, ensuring no one is left behind.\n\nVision & Objectives\n\nBuilding an equitable global AI ecosystem\n\nVision\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Inclusion for Social Empowerment Working Group will explore pathways that can be used to ensure AI can act as a catalyst for social empowerment. Its focus is to enable participation, expand opportunity, and unlock human potential across languages, abilities, geographies, and cultures. It will centre solutions, capacity building, and scalable models that deliver tangible benefits for all, especially  underserved communities.\n\nLeadership\n\nMr Rajesh Aggarwal\n\nIndia Co-Chair\n\nSecretary, Department for Empowerment of Persons with   Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of   India\n\nMr. Rajesh Aggarwal is currently serving as Secretary for the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). Across multiple roles at a federal and state level, he has championed the use of technology to improve governance, playing a foundational role in the creation and improvement of the Digilocker, Jeevan Praman and other significant e-governance programmes. Mr. Aggarwal also has a distinguished track record in making public services and infrastructure accessible for persons with disabilities, including ensuring government websites and public spaces are inclusive for all.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nNigeria\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nKey Issues\n\nUnderstanding the global AI divide and our approach to bridging it\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTranslating potential AI-driven benefits into tangible outcomes depends on the readiness of deployers and users to effectively manage and use the technology. This means providing relevant AI literacy, awareness and training to not just beneficiaries, but those who ensure they are available to the beneficiaries – such as last-mile field   workers, educators, administrators and even managers of developers.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe fragmented nature of the development of AI tools and initiatives for social empowerment means that at present, effective solutions cannot be replicated or scaled up easily. This emphasises the need for mechanisms to actively share technical   learnings and guidance that can ensure that successful programmes in one region can be translated to others.\n\nThe Impact\n\nTo ensure that these AI technologies are able to truly deliver their transformative potential, it is important for them to actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users, including those from the Global South and from traditionally underserved communities. Efforts to improve inclusivity-by design need to be continued to ensure the improvement of AI systems’ safety, relevance and usability\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n16th December 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Hyderabad)\n\nUpcoming\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.

While these developments can drive efficiency and innovation, they also risk displacing   segments of the workforce, particularly in labour-intensive and intermediary roles,   potentially widening existing socio-economic divides if not managed carefully.\n\nThe Solution\n\nAt the same time, many countries, especially in the Global South, face capacity and   resource gaps that constrain their ability to prepare workers for the AI-enabled   economy. This presents an opportunity for the international community to collaborate   on meaningful reskilling initiatives that build workforce readiness for the digital and AI driven future.\n\nThe Impact\n\nEnsuring a just and inclusive transition requires prioritising reskilling and upskilling   initiatives that equip individuals affected by automation with the capabilities needed to   adapt to new and emerging roles.\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n5th-6th January 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Guwahati)\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.

The Inclusion for Social Empowerment thematic working group aims to enable the development and adoption of inclusive AI for social empowerment of all, ensuring no one is left behind.\n\nVision & Objectives\n\nBuilding an equitable global AI ecosystem\n\nVision\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Inclusion for Social Empowerment Working Group will explore pathways that can be used to ensure AI can act as a catalyst for social empowerment. Its focus is to enable participation, expand opportunity, and unlock human potential across languages, abilities, geographies, and cultures. It will centre solutions, capacity building, and scalable models that deliver tangible benefits for all, especially  underserved communities.\n\nLeadership\n\nMr Rajesh Aggarwal\n\nIndia Co-Chair\n\nSecretary, Department for Empowerment of Persons with   Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of   India\n\nMr. Rajesh Aggarwal is currently serving as Secretary for the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). Across multiple roles at a federal and state level, he has championed the use of technology to improve governance, playing a foundational role in the creation and improvement of the Digilocker, Jeevan Praman and other significant e-governance programmes. Mr. Aggarwal also has a distinguished track record in making public services and infrastructure accessible for persons with disabilities, including ensuring government websites and public spaces are inclusive for all.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nNigeria\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nKey Issues\n\nUnderstanding the global AI divide and our approach to bridging it\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTranslating potential AI-driven benefits into tangible outcomes depends on the readiness of deployers and users to effectively manage and use the technology. This means providing relevant AI literacy, awareness and training to not just beneficiaries, but those who ensure they are available to the beneficiaries – such as last-mile field   workers, educators, administrators and even managers of developers.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe fragmented nature of the development of AI tools and initiatives for social empowerment means that at present, effective solutions cannot be replicated or scaled up easily. This emphasises the need for mechanisms to actively share technical   learnings and guidance that can ensure that successful programmes in one region can be translated to others.\n\nThe Impact\n\nTo ensure that these AI technologies are able to truly deliver their transformative potential, it is important for them to actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users, including those from the Global South and from traditionally underserved communities. Efforts to improve inclusivity-by design need to be continued to ensure the improvement of AI systems’ safety, relevance and usability\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n16th December 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Hyderabad)\n\nUpcoming\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.

The Inclusion for Social Empowerment thematic working group aims to enable the development and adoption of inclusive AI for social empowerment of all, ensuring no one is left behind.\n\nVision & Objectives\n\nBuilding an equitable global AI ecosystem\n\nVision\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Inclusion for Social Empowerment Working Group will explore pathways that can be used to ensure AI can act as a catalyst for social empowerment. Its focus is to enable participation, expand opportunity, and unlock human potential across languages, abilities, geographies, and cultures. It will centre solutions, capacity building, and scalable models that deliver tangible benefits for all, especially  underserved communities.\n\nLeadership\n\nMr Rajesh Aggarwal\n\nIndia Co-Chair\n\nSecretary, Department for Empowerment of Persons with   Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of   India\n\nMr. Rajesh Aggarwal is currently serving as Secretary for the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). Across multiple roles at a federal and state level, he has championed the use of technology to improve governance, playing a foundational role in the creation and improvement of the Digilocker, Jeevan Praman and other significant e-governance programmes. Mr. Aggarwal also has a distinguished track record in making public services and infrastructure accessible for persons with disabilities, including ensuring government websites and public spaces are inclusive for all.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nNigeria\n\nCountry Co-Chair\n\nKey Issues\n\nUnderstanding the global AI divide and our approach to bridging it\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTranslating potential AI-driven benefits into tangible outcomes depends on the readiness of deployers and users to effectively manage and use the technology. This means providing relevant AI literacy, awareness and training to not just beneficiaries, but those who ensure they are available to the beneficiaries – such as last-mile field   workers, educators, administrators and even managers of developers.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe fragmented nature of the development of AI tools and initiatives for social empowerment means that at present, effective solutions cannot be replicated or scaled up easily. This emphasises the need for mechanisms to actively share technical   learnings and guidance that can ensure that successful programmes in one region can be translated to others.\n\nThe Impact\n\nTo ensure that these AI technologies are able to truly deliver their transformative potential, it is important for them to actively account for and accommodate the diverse needs, identities, and experiences of all users, including those from the Global South and from traditionally underserved communities. Efforts to improve inclusivity-by design need to be continued to ensure the improvement of AI systems’ safety, relevance and usability\n\nMeeting Schedule\n\n16th December 2026\n\nHybrid Meeting (Hyderabad)\n\nUpcoming\n\nHybrid\n\nSubmit Your Ideas\n\nHelp shape the future of global AI by sharing your perspectives, suggestions, and expertise.
